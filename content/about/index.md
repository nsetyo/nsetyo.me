Hi, I'm Setyo. I've been creating and breaking code since 2010. For now, I
mostly focus on software development, especially full-stack web development.

During my journey in software development, I've been learning and using many
programming languages such as C, Java, PHP, Rust, and Javascript/Typescript.
