Ever since I was a kid, I’ve had a special connection with computers. I don’t
remember exactly when it started, but I remember the awe I felt the first time I
sat in front of a computer screen. I was hooked.

Though I taught myself programming on my own, it wasn’t until college that I had
my first formal programming class. I learned languages like C, PHP, and Java,
and even studied assembly in my electronics class. I also took a cryptography
class and learned more about cybersecurity.

Even with everything I learned in school, I quickly realized how much there was
still to explore. Technology moves so fast—new tools and languages are always
popping up. I love that about it. Lately, I’ve been getting into Rust because
it’s fast and pretty cool. There’s always something new to try, and that’s what
keeps me excited about this.
