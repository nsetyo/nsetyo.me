Ever since I was a kid, I’ve had a special connection with computers. I don’t
remember exactly when it started, but I remember the awe I felt the first time I
sat in front of a computer screen. I was hooked.

In 9th grade, I got my first personal computer. It wasn’t new, but I didn’t
care. I spent hours taking it apart and putting it back together, making
mistakes along the way. I’d tweak the operating system, adjust settings, and
mess with configurations just to see what happened. I remember installing
different operating systems, sometimes breaking things, but always figuring out
how to fix them.

Though I taught myself programming on my own, it wasn’t until college that I had
my first formal programming class. I learned languages like C, PHP, and Java,
and even studied assembly in my electronics class. I also took a cryptography
class and learned more about cybersecurity.

Even with everything I learned in school, I quickly realized how much there was
still to explore. Technology moves so fast—new tools and languages are always
popping up. I love that about it. Lately, I’ve been getting into Rust because
it’s fast and pretty cool. There’s always something new to try, and that’s what
keeps me excited about this.

I can’t wait to see where it takes me next.
